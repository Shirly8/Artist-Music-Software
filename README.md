## üé∂ WHY I CREATED TUNETELL?
Music to me is more than just music. It's storytelling, a way to express emotions, experiences and narratives. As a songwriter, I write songs like movies, showing character development, emotional changes, and even plot twists. I want listeners to capture the same experiences as they get when they watch movies.

Whether it's understanding the intricacy of Taylor Swift's lyrics in TTPD or the disses Drake and Kendrick made at each other in their rap sogns, Tunetell provides an immersive listening experiences like no other. Let's appreciate music on a whole new level.
