# üéµ Lyrical: The Next Level of Music Streaming and Lyrics üéµ
Lyrical is a revolutionary music streaming app that goes beyond just listening to music. It goes as far as to tell about the story, the inspiration, and the meaning behind every lyric, every song

## üåü WHAT MAKES LYRICAL UNIQUE? 
- **Real-Time Lyrics and Interpretation**: Powered by both Genius API and Spotify, Tuntell synchronizes song lyrics and song meanings in real-time all at the same time. As the music plays, lyrics are displayed on the left side of the screen, and song interpretations on the right. 
- **Artist-Centric Interface**: Lyrical solely focuses on the artist and their albums/songs like a movie franchise series. Explore playlists, and albums and queue up songs from the artist.

- **Visual Storytelling** - Song Interpretation like a visual slideshow, providing artist's quotes, stories, analysis, and inspiration


## üé∂ WHY I CREATED LYRICAL?
Music to me is more than just music. It's storytelling, a way to express emotions, experiences, and narratives. As a songwriter, I write songs like movies, showing character development, emotional changes, and even plot twists. I want listeners to capture the same experiences as they get when they watch movies.

Whether it's understanding the intricacy of Taylor Swift's lyrics in TTPD or the disses Drake and Kendrick made at each other in their rap songs, Lyrical provides an immersive listening experience like no other. Let's appreciate music on a whole new level.
