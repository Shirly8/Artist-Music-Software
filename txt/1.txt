Someone said that we were never soulmate
That's why they call it heartbreak
So this dance is the last date
And that one kiss feels amazing
And my one wish is your loving
But I know you couldn't give it
And you leave without a reason
So it leaves me feeling beaten

You know what it means when you said you ain't my friend
And I know that it's true but I end up in dead end

You said you wanna go now then baby come on
I thought you was so good til you show this song
And if you really love me, then why we're you gone
Cuz I know you miss me, it took you this long

How did I leave you
How did I leave you
How did I leave you
La la la day

How did I leave you
How did I leave you
How did I leave you
La la la day
